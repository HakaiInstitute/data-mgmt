      <description>Welcome to a new platform to share blog posts, how-to guides, example data anlayses etc. I encourage people to publicize some of their hard work so that you and others may benefit!
Why? Because of the unreasonable effectiveness of Public Work.
We are committed to ensuring that all the data generated with Hakai funding is made available to the broader research community and downstream users. To do so, we practice Open Science; the practice of science in such a way that other scientists, and the public, can collaborate and contribute.</description>

      <description>Welcome, friends, to a data blog by the Hakai Institute.
Explore environmental data with scientists as they seek to uncover the secrets of our complex coastal ecosystems.
Below are some examples of data visualizations you can work on in our GitHub Repository
I really hope you like what you find, and you consider making your work public so that you and others can benefit from collaboration.</description>
