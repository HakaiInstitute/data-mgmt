      <description>Welcome to a new platform to share blog posts, how-to guides, example data anlayses etc. I encourage people to publicize some of their hard work so that you and others may benefit!
Why? Because of the unreasonable effectiveness of Public Work.
We are committed to ensuring that all the data generated with Hakai funding is made available to the broader research community and downstream users. To do so, we practice Open Science; the practice of science in such a way that other scientists, and the public, can collaborate and contribute.</description>
