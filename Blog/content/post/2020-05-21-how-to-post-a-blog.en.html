<p>Welcome to a new platform to share blog posts, how-to guides, example data anlayses etc. I encourage people to publicize some of their hard work so that you and others may benefit!</p>
<p>Step by step instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open R-Studio and create new project by checkin out project from version control</li>
<li>set URL to <a href="https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/open-data-mgmt" class="uri">https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/open-data-mgmt</a></li>
<li>Open project</li>
<li>Go to files, click on Blog folder, click Blog.Rproj to open a
‘sub-project’ within the open-data-mgmt project. Opening the Blog.Rproj file will give you addins for making posts and previewing a website!</li>
<li>Navigate to the top of the R-Studio window and click add-ins</li>
<li>Click serve site. You should see the website appear in the viewer. Changing files and saving them will update the website preview.</li>
<li>To create a new post: navigate to Addins and click New post.</li>
<li>Once your post is done: commit, pull, push to GitHub.</li>
<li>Check <a href="https://hakai-open-data-mgmt.netlify.app" class="uri">https://hakai-open-data-mgmt.netlify.app</a></li>
