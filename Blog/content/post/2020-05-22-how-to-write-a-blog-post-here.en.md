Welcome to a new platform to share blog posts, how-to guides, and data anlayses for working with Open Data and the Hakai Institute. I encourage people to publicize some of their hard work so that you and others may benefit!

Why? Because of the unreasonable effectiveness of Public Work. 

We are committed to ensuring that all the data generated with Hakai funding is made available to the broader research community and downstream users. To do so, we practice Open Science; the practice of science in such a way that other scientists, and the public, can collaborate and contribute. To do so, research data, methods documents, publications and other research processes are freely available under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.

The Hakai Institute is funded by the Tula Foundation, a non-profit charity which is obligated to
ensure that all activities it funds are not for commercial use and are open and available to the
public, including research data. Similarly, much of our scientific research is done in partnership
with publicly funded scientists, mandating broad public access to their outputs (papers, reports
and data).

For scientists at any stage of their careers, Open Science development offers practice in collaboration, documentation, and interface design that complement other kinds of research outputs such as traditional peer-reviewd papers, posters, and oral presentations.

Why write a blog? **Do it for yourself, not an audience.**
Writing a blog post can crystalize your own understanding of a difficult problem.There are many other reasons why you might want to start a blog, but the only way you're going to be successful in the long time is if it's for you.

How to be successful:

* Don't focus on producing something for a your audience, focus on what you want to think about, work on, demonstrate... for future you or as a way to clarify your thoughts NOW.

* **Make your work public by default.** Despite the fact it's written mainly for yourself, make it public with that proviso! As scientists, often we fear being wrong and as a result we never show our ideas until we're convinced they're right. You can convince yourself one way or another faster with a blog. 

Step by step instructions to post on this blog (for Hakai staff and affiliates):

- Open R-Studio and create new project by checking out project from version control
- set URL to https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/open-data-mgmt
- Open project
- Checkout the development branch of the git repo by going to the top right of R Studio's git pane and selecting develop
- Go to files, click on Blog folder, click Blog.Rproj to open a 
'sub-project' within the open-data-mgmt project. Opening the Blog.Rproj file will give you addins for making posts and previewing a website!
- Navigate to the top of the R-Studio window and click add-ins
- Click serve site. You should see the website appear in the viewer. Changing files and saving them will update the website preview.
- To create a new post: navigate to Addins and click New post.
- Once your post is done: commit, pull, push to GitHub.
- Check https://hakai-open-data-mgmt.netlify.app

You can see and hear our entire discussion from meeting this week below! I plan to upload these meetings to youtube so that others may benefit from our discussions!
