Welcome to a new platform to share blog posts, how-to guides, example data anlayses etc. I encourage people to publicize some of their hard work so that you and others may benefit!

Why? Because of the unreasonable effectiveness of Public Work. 

We are committed to ensuring that all the data generated with Hakai funding is made available to the broader research community and downstream users. To do so, we practice Open Science; the practice of science in such a way that other scientists, and the public, can collaborate and contribute. To do so, research data, methods documents, publications and other research processes are freely available under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.

The Hakai Institute is funded by the Tula Foundation, a non-profit charity which is obligated to
ensure that all activities it funds are not for commercial use and are open and available to the
public, including research data. Similarly, much of our scientific research is done in partnership
with publicly funded scientists, mandating broad public access to their outputs (papers, reports
and data).

For scientists at any stage of their careers, Open Science development offers practice in collaboration, documentation, and interface design that complement other kinds of research outputs such as traditional peer-reviewd papers, posters, and oral presentations.
